# Tidify

-- **tidy up and simplify**

**Erste Digital Hackathon 2024 Winning Project** ([website](https://www.erstedigital.com/sk/hackathon))

Tidify is an AI-powered application designed to help you declutter responsibly.
By identifying the materials of items and highlighting their environmental impact, Tidify suggests sustainable ways to reuse or dispose of them.
This makes the decluttering process simpler and more eco-friendly.
App uses [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/en).

AI tools were used during project development.
