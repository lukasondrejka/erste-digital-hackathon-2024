# Tidify

-- **tidy up and simplify**

**[Erste Digital Hackathon](https://www.erstedigital.com/sk/hackathon) Winning Project**

Tidify is a mobile-first, AI-powered web application that helps you responsibly get rid of clutter. 
Users can specify an item, and the app identifies its potential materials and highlights their impact. 
Tidify also suggests ways to reuse or properly dispose of items, making decluttering easier and more environmentally friendly.

AI tools were used during project development.
